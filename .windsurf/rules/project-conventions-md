## Package Management

- **Use pnpm exclusively** - All package management commands should use pnpm instead of npm
- Use `pnpm install` for installing dependencies
- Use `pnpm add <package>` for adding new packages
- Use `pnpm <script>` for running scripts
- Use `pnpm dev` for development server
- Use `pnpm build` for production builds
- Never use npm commands in this project
