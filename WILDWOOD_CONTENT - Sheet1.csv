Wildwoods Studio,"Connecting you to yourself, others, and the Earth.",801-310-7119,emily.lacey@gmail.com,StickWork,"StickWork Neural System Retraining is an active nervous system training system that rewires habitual tension into calm and ease. This is the most powerful and rapidly life changing thing I have experienced and I love being able to bring this to you. Is it challenging? Yes. But it changes you and gives you a chance to change the trajectory of your life, modify the way you experience and interpret the world, and space to choose instead of being tied to habits and learned patterns that no longer serve you. Many people find it very useful as an active recovery or maintinence tool as well.",StickWork,"Stickwork is an active process of nervous system training and somatic education. This approach bypasses the thinking mind and directly accesses the nervous system. We endeavor to address all layers of your system so the trauma, pain, and addictions have no where left to hide. This is not massage, but like an internal martial arts training where together, we are teaching your body to dissolve the conflict within and learn new ways to interpret and interact with the world. This is a powerful tool to reboot and redirect your life. Each session is as unique as you and the challenges you are facing. Training sessions can range from movement excercises and practicing relaxation in a BodyRock session to a full stickwork session with various implements like the sticks and percussion tools being used for deep release and retraining. All StickWork sessions include an intake call, skills to practice at home, and a follow up conversation. Because we are changing your perception and interaction with the world, it is recommended that in the beginning, you schedule 3-5 sessions 1-2 weeks apart as you learn to live with more freedom, choice, and joy.  My children regularly ask for sessions as it helps them overcome discomfort and pain and relieve built up tension and anxiety. There are many options available to help you where you are stuck or need support.
